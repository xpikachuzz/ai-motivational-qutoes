"Do not think about other things, there is only one thing you can do. So master that one thing. Do not forget. What you must imagine is always that you, yourself, are the strongest. You do not need outside enemies. For you, the one you have to fight is none other than your own image."
"Life is like a tube of toothpaste. When you’ve used all the toothpaste down to the last squeeze, that’s when you’ve really lived. Live with all your might, and struggle as long as you have life.”"
"Just like games, no matter how well you have things lined up in your life, there’s always something to keep you on your toes."
Do exactly as you like. That is the true meaning of pleasure. Pleasure leads to joy and joy leads to happiness.
